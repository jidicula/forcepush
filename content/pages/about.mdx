I'm Johanan Idicula, a software developer. This is where I write about software engineering, cooking (eventually), and finance (later). My views are my own and do not represent those of my employer.

My resume can be viewed [here](/jidicula-resume/jidicula-resume.pdf).

Questions? Comments? My email is at the bottom of this page.
