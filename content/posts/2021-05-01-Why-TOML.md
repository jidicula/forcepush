Config files should be readable and editable by both humans and machines. What defines this? A format with a clear specification (for the machines to parse) and easy on the eyes/fingers (for humans to read and modify). There are a few popular options:
* XML: Basically HTML - tricky to read and tricky to edit by hand. Diffs will be messy.
* .INI: Several competing specifications, so really not even worth considering.
* YAML: An improvement over XML in readability, but the whitespace-as-syntax might trip you up. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) uses this for defining workflows, and tools like [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically) and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) read configurations from YAML files.
* JSON: The de facto format for passing around data in webdev, with a dictionary-like syntax. Hope you like commas and braces.
* TOML: A happy medium between human and machine readability. Used for specifying Rust project dependencies in `Cargo.toml`, and for [Python project configs in `pyproject.toml`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0631/).

I reach for TOML if I have the choice.
