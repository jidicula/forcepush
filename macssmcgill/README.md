## McGill Anatomy and Cell Biology Students' Society

The McGill Anatomy and Cell Biology Student Society (MACSS) aims to serve the academic and social needs of all students in Anatomy and Cell Biology! Our office is always open to visitors so come by to chat or if you need gloves, a lab coat, or NTCs of the highest quality!

Some of our famous events include our Year-End Formal as well as our annual Halloween Apartment Crawl, both of which are attended by students from a variety of departments. Throughout the year we hold many smaller events such as BBQs, Gerts nights, and popular Wine and Cheeses to catalyze networking among professors and students.

The Anatomy and Cell Biology Program itself is renowned because it incorporates courses from many other biomedical departments such as physiology, biochemistry, and biology, and is one of the few North American programs that offer undergraduates the opportunity to study anatomy using human cadavers. Some of our best courses include Systemic Anatomy (ANAT 214) and Dynamic Histology (ANAT 261).
